# practice-data-struct
Playground to practice Data Structures in TypeScript / JavaScript. The code is written in TS and then compiled using `tsc` into JS.

Exercises come initially from Codecademy's courses on Linear and Complex Data Structures in JS. They have been slightly modified wherever necessary to make them work in TS.

## Requirements

`Node.js` installation required.

`TypeScript` required. Use npm to install globally: `npm install -g typescript`. 

For more options, please see [TypeScript Downloads](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download)

## Setup

Fork and clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Firgrep/practice-data-struct.git`

Enter `npm start` to run the script from src/index.js

## Tests

`npm run randomheap` Tests the Min Heap Data Structure with some randomized elements. 

`npm run tenthousand` Tests the Min Heap Data Structure with 10 000 elements. 

`npm run menu` Tests the Trees (TreeNode) Data Structure

`npm run bird` Tests the HashMap Data Structure
